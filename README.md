# Fekra Task - Language Learning App

A React Native language learning application that provides interactive exercises for learning, featuring multiple exercise types, progress tracking, and bilingual support (English/Arabic).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Patterns

### State Management

- **Zustand** for global state management (instead of Redux/Context)
- Persistent storage using AsyncStorage
- Modular store design with separate concerns

### Navigation

- **React Navigation v6** with Native Stack Navigator
- Screen-based navigation: Start ‚Üí Exercise ‚Üí Success/Failure

### Internationalization

- **i18next** for multi-language support
- Dynamic language switching (English/Arabic)
- RTL support for Arabic language
- to avoid app restart after each language change, i have created handle-rtl file which is responsible of handling RTL in the app without the need for app restart

### Styling & Responsiveness

- **react-native-size-matters** for responsive scaling
- Absolute imports using Babel module resolver
- Custom design system with centralized colors and components
